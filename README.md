# Machine Learning Course 1: University of Washington
This first course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction, you will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output. In subsequent courses, you will delve into the components of this black box by examining models and algorithms.  Together, these pieces form the machine learning pipeline, which you will use in developing intelligent applications.

Learning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:
   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  
   -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.
   -Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
   -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
   -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
   -Implement these techniques in Python.
